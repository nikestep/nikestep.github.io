# Lost time?

I have experienced a full loss of the concept of time. it's almost inexplicable - as in I don't know how to explain it. Time was missing. It wasn't gone, it just didn't exist.

I lived in a world where time, space, we're not a thing. They simply vanished.

I do not know how long this state lasted - tracking time without a sense of time is logically impossible. There are no refernce points as I don't know when it started or ended.

This is one of the most disturbing things I have ever experienced. That whole episode had a major "fracture" of time in my mind. When I knew it existed I still lost track of date, day of the week, month, time of year, etc.
