Did you ever wonder about the guy?
The guy who, of course, is a lie?

They say he never made much sense
But then again, he hadn't has his comeuppance

And why did he deserve?
Well, because, he refused to swerve

For to swerve would be to weave
And when one weaves they all deceive

In that act we see the true man
The one who will not take up the can

Should the man pick up the can
He would call the whole clan

With the whole clan notified
Our new hero would be satisfied

Now we can all sit back
And watch them all tack

They will reach rough water
But we know they won't falter

For the guidance of that man
Will carry them forth with the better plan

And never forget where we started
Back at the beginning before we departed

The guy was a lie
But that guy made us cry
