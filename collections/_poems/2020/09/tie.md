title: Should've been a hat

```
Oh my goodness, me goodness my
Look over there at that tie
I think we would agree that's definitely not fly
Perhaps instead to try a hat?
Just make sure it doesn't look like that
Or we'll be right back talking about the flies
You know - the ones right there by those eyes
This is when you'd want a fly hat
To swat away that pesky ol' gnat
But let us return to the original tie
It is unchanged by my eye
I'm afraid more of this
May take me away from my bliss
The bliss of course by which one yawns
Ready to seek out their reprieve 'till dawn
```
