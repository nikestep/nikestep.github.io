The beauty of cast iron is that these are solid pans with a lot of great properties and if cared for properly they'll last a lifetime.

## Thoughts on pan care

*   You can use metal utensils on a pan as long as you're not digging into the surface
*   For very oily dishes (pizza anyone?) I wipe the pan with a paper towel to mop up whaatever I can before I get to washing it later
*   Wash and quickly season after every use
    *   Do not simply rub a thin layer of oil on the pan and put it away
*   You can store pans together with nothing in between as long as you're not banging them together too much

## Washing procedure

1.  Rinse in the hotest water I can get out of the tap
    *   I usually rinse until the water is clear - no more brown oily water
1.  (Optional) use the chainmail swatch to scrape off dried/stuck bits of food
1.  Clean by scrubbing with soap and the scrubby side of a sponge - rinse clean
1.  Dry the pan with a towel
    *   I don't bother to make sure it's 100% dry
1.  Heat the pan on the stove
    *   This fully dries the pan
    *   This prepares the pan for a quick seasoning
    *   You may need to move the pan around periodically to get the whole pan heated
1.  Once the pan is hot:
    1.  Take a paper towel and fold it at least twice (I usually do three times) - the folds are for the sake of your fingers
    1.  Put a small amount if vegetable oil in the bottom of the pan - no more than the size of a quarter in most cases
    1.  Wipe the oil over the entire inner surface of the pan (bottom, sides, etc)
    1.  Wipe the pan again with a clean side of the folded paper towel
    1.  Wait until the pan starts to smoke lightly
    1.  Wipe the pan again with another clean side of the paper towel (you may have to fold it again)
    1.  Turn off the burner
